I created workflow file from my local repos and push it.
WHen I go to action tab, it is not recorgnized and asks me to create action.????
it has to be workflows, not workflow

master -> master (refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/run_app.yml` without `workflow` scope)
